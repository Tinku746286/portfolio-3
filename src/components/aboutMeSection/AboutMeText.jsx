      <p>
        Hello! I'm Tinku Kumar, a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer and Computer Science Engineering student.
         I specialize in web development with the MERN stack, problem-solving through Data Structures & Algorithms,
          and creating intuitive UI/UX experiences.

          I enjoy building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solutions. 
          Currently a pre-final year student at IES College of Technology, Bhopal (CGPA: 7.8), 
          Iâ€™ve worked on projects like WonderLust (rental platform), MicroFund (loan management), 
          and ConnectChat (real-time messaging). When I'm not coding, you can find me running
          , working out, or drawing inspiration from mentors and peers.
      </p>
